A header only library for algorithms and data structures written in **`C`** using macros.
The data structures used are similar to the ones present in the **`C++ STL`**.

# Simple Example
```c
#include <sgc/vector.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// vec <=> vector<int>
SGC_INIT(VECTOR, int, vec)

int main(void) {
    vec v;
    vec_init(&v);

    vec_push_back(&v, 1);
    vec_push_back(&v, 5);

    *vec_at(&v, 0) = 2;

    for_each(i IN v AS vec) {
        printf("%d ", *i);
    }

    vec_free(&v);
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```bash
$ ./vector
size: 2
2 5

# Features

# Usage

To initialize the vector we simply used the **`SGC_INIT`** macro. It will generate
the **`vec`** structure and corresponding functions which all start with **vec_**.

*Note: the macro will also generate some functions with the \_p\_ prefix.
Those funcions are ment to be private and should only be invoked internaly.*

In order to generate a vector of a type some functions may need to exist
so the library can know how to work with the type. For **`int`** those functions
are **`int_copy`** and **`int_free`** and they are generated by the library along with function for many other primitive types.

*More examples on how to use the library can be found in the examples directory.*

## Map Example
```c
#include <sgc/map.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// map <=> map<int, double>
SGC_INIT_DICT(MAP, char, double, map)

int main(void) {
    map m;
    map_init(&m);

    map_set(&m, 'a', 10.0);
    *map_at(&m, 'b') = 11.1;

    map_it it = map_find(&m, 'c');
    if (map_it_valid(it)) {
        return 1;
    }

    for_each(i IN m AS map) {
        printf("%c -> %.2f\n", i->key, i->value);
    }

    map_free(&m);
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```bash
$ ./map
a -> 10.00
b -> 11.10
```
To initialize dictionary type data structures the **`SGC_INIT_DICT`** macro should be used.
It is identical to **`SGC_INIT`** but takes one more type parameter for the key.

# Fixed Size Data Structures

The library supports a few fixed size (fs) data structures. Most have identical implementations to their dynamic
counterparts, only **`fs_unordered_map`** and **`fs_unordered_set`** are different since they are implemented using 
closed hashing as oposed to their dynamic variants which are implemnted using open hashing.

All fixed size containers are named with the **`fs_`** prefix. To use a fixed size vector identical to the one above the
**`SGC_INIT_FS`** macro can be used:
```c
#include <sgc/fs_vector.h>

// vec <=> vector<int> with capacity 100
SGC_INIT_FS(FS_VECTOR, int, 100, vec)
```
Similar to the fixed size vector, a fixed size unordered map can be initialized using the
**`SGC_INIT_FS_DICT`** macro:
```c
#include <sgc/fs_unordered_map.h>

// umap <=> unordered_map<char, double> with capacity 100
SGC_INIT_FS_DICT(FS_UNORDERED_MAP, char, double, 100, umap)
```
Fixed size containers ignore insertions if they are already full.
This behavior can be modified, see **error.c** within the examples directory.

# Data Structures

Every data structure defines the following functions:
**`init`** **`copy`** **`free`** **`size`** **`empty`** **`set_sharing`** and **`set_owning`**

Dictionary data structures also have:
**`set_sharing_key`** and **`set_owning_key`**

Fixed size data structurs also have:
**`max`**

Now follows a table showing which data stuctures have which functionalities defined:

The functions are mostly identical to methods within the c++ STL with a few exceptions.
The **`at`** functions correspond to **`operator[]`**.
**`insert`**, **`erase`**, **`at`** and **`set`** for **`vector`** and **`deque`** are used to insert
element at specified position as opposed to **`map`** and **`unordered_map`** functions
which work with keys.

# Iterators

Some data structures have iterators binded to them, there is three types of iterators, 
**random access iterator**, **bidirectional iterator** and **forward iterator**. The iterator
structure for the associated data structure had the same name as the data structure
with **_it** attacked to the end of it, eg for **vec** it would be **vec_it**.

Functions starting with **`it`** take the iterator as input parameter instead of the data structure
- **Forward iterator** is associated with the following functions:
**`begin`** **`cbegin`** **`end`** **`cend`** **`it_data`** **`it_go_next`** **`it_eq`** and **`it_valid`**
- **Bidirectional iterator** is associated with all the function from forward iterator and also the following:
**`it_go_prev`**
- **Random access iterator** is associated with all the function from bidirectional iterator and also the following:
**`from`** **`cfrom`** **`it_move`** and **`it_diff`**

This table shows which data stucture has access to which iterator:

|               | random access iterator | bidirectional iterator | forward iterator |
| ------------- | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------: |
| vector        | **x**                      |                        |                  |
| deque         | **x**                      |                        |                  |
| list          |                        | **x**                      |                  |
| forward_list  |                        |                        | **x**                |
| map           |                        | **x**                      |                  |
| unordered_map |                        | **x**                      |                  |
| set           |                        | **x**                      |                  |
| unordered_set |                        | **x**                      |                  |

# Algorithms

The library gives access some algorithms most of which require an iterator to be able to work.
If we for example wanted to initialize the vector to have access to **`qsort`** and **`eq`** functions they could be initialized like this:
```c
#include <sgc/vector.h>
#include <sgc/algorithm.h>
SGC_INIT(VECTOR, int, vec, QSORT, EQ)
```
This will generate functions such as **`vec_qsort`** and **`vec_eq`** among others.
This table shows which algorithms are generated with which initializer group:

The sort algorithm does not require an iterator but an array function instead.
